# Python Packages Updater
A Python script used to check all Python packages for those in need of an update, and update those requiring it

An Excel document is output to show the user when their packages were last updated.

Download and run the Python package to update your Python packages. This may take a while if you have a lot of packages or haven't done it for a while, but this is a nice tool for keeping your modules up to date
